Serve up owt yer fancy on t'fly.


** What's This?

A Flask app exposing an endpoint whose request handling behaviour is configured by the request itself.

*** Security
*This works by evaluating arbitrary user-supplied strings as code. This is grossly insecure by its very nature; don't expose it to the internet!*

There's support for basic auth via ~--auth="username:sha256(password)"~ but still, exercise caution. It would not be difficult to accidentally make an ~owt~ API call that irreversibly destroyed your own machine.

*** Why?

The primary motivation is rapid prototyping against new machine learning models from languages other than Python. So often the newest hotness drops with a checkpoint and a Python client, and using this outside of the specific ecosystem in which it is designed to run means one of:

1. FFI-wrapping the library to get native-looking calls in your language (or use an embedded Python if your language has it)
   - Painful and bespoke-to-each-new-library work to figure out how to make all necessary requirements, virtualenv setup, CUDA flags, etc available.
   - Or, now your software only works inside a virtualenv.
2. Spawn ~python some_project.py --flag=...~" as a child process
   - Handle communication over stdin/out/err can be a pain.
   - Wrapping
3. Docker-ify it
   - Long; CUDA can be annoying; still need to expose the logic by one of the other methods.
4. Building a lightweight API backend exposing the Python logic and writing client code in your language of choice
   - Annoying boilerplate, the time between "I can run ~python generate.py --animal=cat > pic.png~ on my machine" and "I have some ~generate :: Animal -> IO Image~" can be >1h.
   - Either one new service for every new library you want to test out, or now you need to maintain a growing monolith of unrelated endpoints

~owt~ aims to make #4 less painful, at the cost of security and sanity, by providing a single service capable of serving arbitrary new logic without requiring changes to ~owt~ itself.

*** How?
The cost of supporting some new system is pushed to the client, who must send adaptor code (a request handler, essentially) along with the request. This creates a virtual endpoint on the fly, giving complete control over the serving logic to the API user.

Writing the adaptor code is a one-time cost for each new virtual endpoint, made cheaper by having access to ~owt.summat~, a collection of composable building blocks.

*** Examples

The following examples (in ~example/~) could all be run one-by-one without any need to restart or rebuild ~owt~. The first one is shown a few different ways to give a flavour of usage. Subsequent examples just show ~curl~ in tandem with an adaptor ~.py~ file, but it's easy to see how one could extend from here to call to ~owt~ from any other language.

**** Echo Server
By default, the function named ~run(request, **kwargs)~ in the user-supplied code will be used to handle the request.
Code and (optionally) arguments are supplied as ~code_b64~ and ~kwargs_b64~. ~kwargs_b64~ is ~eval~'d to get the resulting dictionary, so can itself contain richer logic to build up arguments.

#+end_export

**** Text to Speech API
A more complex example demonstrating wrapping Suno's OSS TTS model [https://github.com/suno-ai/bark](Bark).
The client provides an adaptor that responds with a stream of bytes, allowing the generated audio to be streamed in chunks, sentence-by-sentence.
Responses are cached for the lifetime of the ~owt~ server for each combination of ~(text, speaker)~.
The ~preload_models()~ call makes the first call take a while as VRAM is populated, but the weights remain in memory so subsequent calls are cheaper.
To avoid this breaking other ~owt~ uses, one can spin up multiple instances of ~owt~, each handling a different kind of task and with different resource profiles.

***** Python Adaptor
#+INCLUDE: "example/bark/bark.py" src python

***** Save audio via cURL
#+INCLUDE: "example/bark/bark.sh" src bash

***** Stream audio via JS
See ~example/bark/bark.html~ for usage.
#+INCLUDE: "example/bark/bark.js" src javascript

***** Ad-hoc Web Server
In fact we can go one step further and create an adhoc endpoint that serves us the rendered ~bark.html~ Jinja2 template.

The ~owt~ arguments can be passed as GET query parameters as well as POST JSON data, so we can actually write a handler that embeds the entire HTML into the query with this Python-in-Python-in-Bash curiosity:

#+INCLUDE: "example/bark/bark_construct_url.sh" src bash

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :exports both :results html
./example/bark/bark_construct_curl.sh http://localhost:9876
#+END_SRC

#+begin_export html
